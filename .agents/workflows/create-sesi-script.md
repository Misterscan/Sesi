description: Create a script using sesi.
---

### **The most important thing to remember is that the user can edit the .sesi files in the editor, so you should always use the editor to edit the .sesi files. You should NEVER edit the .sesi files in the terminal.**

1. **Never Hardcode Data Into the View**: Isolate raw content, biographies, statistics, etc. into a structured database layer using native typed Sesi outputs.
2. **Build Sesi Compiler/Builder Scripts**: Write a `.sesi` script that uses Sesi's builtins (`make_dir()`, `list_dir()`, `read_file()`, `write_file()`, `set_alias()`, `workflow()`, `model()`, `image()`, `web_get()`, `web_send()`, `define_tool()`, `list_tools()`, `tool_call()`, `multi_req()`, `import`, `export`, `to_json()`, `from_json()`, `time()`, `random()`, `exec()`, `spawn()`, `structured_output()`, `prompt`, `write_image()`, `write_file()`, `raise_error()`, `error_type()`, and `print`).
3. **Let Sesi Do Its Job**: A Sesi builder script makes the system perfectly repeatable, infinitely scalable, and trivial to refactor. In this repository, the Sesi script is the core product; the end file(s) are merely the byproduct for post edits and making sure our scripts are behaving as anticipated.

**This is a non-negotiable quality bar.**

### ❌ FORBIDDEN:

- Math solvers, calculators, arithmetic pipelines
- Prime number finders, Fibonacci sequences, sorting algorithms
- Unit converters, currency converters, grade calculators
- Budget trackers, invoice generators, tax tools
- Generic "Hello World" clones with no AI interaction
- Compliance checkers, OSHA reports, logistics routers
- Any script whose core loop is just arithmetic with a `print` at the end
- **AI cybernetic, futuristic, sci-fi, or deep-space themes** (e.g., holographic star-charts, cyber-gardens, spatial telemetry, spacecraft command interfaces, alien translators).
- **Cozy, minimalist, Victorian, herbalist, sourdough bakery, cottage-core, candle-lit, or general artisanal themes** (e.g., village herbalist teabags, sourdough yeast logs, candlelit journals, mahogany apothecary drawers, victorian scroll philologists). These are overdone, precious, and clichéd.

These are lazy defaults. They don't demonstrate what makes Sesi unique.

### ✅ REQUIRED — Sesi scripts must use the language's built-ins:

Every script you write must use **at least one** of:

- `memory` — stateful multi-turn context
- `exec()` — concurrent process orchestration
- `web_send()` - sending an HTTP request to a URL
- `web_get()` - collecting data from a URL
- `define_tool()` - categorizing tool calls
- `list_tools()` - displaying custom tools
- `tool_call()` - calling a predefined function
- `multi_req()` - concurrent function execution
- `import` / `export` - reusable configuration modules

#### 🏷️ Lexicon & Vocabulary Guardrails (MANDATORY)

**Completely ban both sci-fi tech-jargon/themes AND cottage-core words/themes.**

#### 🎨 Web Design & UI Guardrails (MANDATORY WHEN APPLICABLE)

**Completely ban standard AI template styles AND generic neon/cyber aesthetics AND minimalist tea-stained cottage wood paper.**
Instead, design unique, high-density interfaces :

- NO glowing lasers or neon cyber grids/themes or ANYTHING FAMILAR.
- **Use typography that rejects standard AI template styles.** Completely ban generic corporate UI fonts like _Inter_, _Outfit_, _Roboto_, or standard system-sans.

The bar is: **"Is this easy to write and read?"** If the answer is no, rewrite it.

## Mandatory Syntax Rules & Quirks

- **Block Termination:** Closing braces `}` for blocks (if, while, try, model) no longer strictly require a following newline or semicolon. Condensed one-liners like `while x {x = x + 1}` are valid.
- **Prompts & Prints:** Inside `prompt` blocks, anonymous model blocks, and `print` statements, literal strings and variables are placed sequentially naturally (e.g., `print "User:" name`). It's highly preferred to **AVOID** use of the `+` operator in these contexts, regardless of its backwards-compatibility.
- **Structured Output Schemas:** Keys in schemas MUST be unquoted identifiers (e.g., `{key: string}` instead of `{"key": string}`). This is a known deviation from standard JSON objects in the Sesi parser.
- **Object Literals:** Conversely, standard object literals `{}` DO require strictly quoted string keys (e.g., `{"name": "Alice"}`).
- **JSON Serialization:** Use `to_json(object)` for valid JSON output. Avoid `str(object)` for JSON.
- **Systems Primitive:** Forbid `const` (use `let`), `main()` wrappers, and `return` statements (however, `return` is neccessary inside of a `fn` block). Focus on side-effects and top-level execution.

## Behavioral Guidelines

- **Never** attempt to execute file modifications via shell/terminal text replacements. Use native file editing tools ONLY.
